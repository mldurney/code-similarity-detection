# Code Simularity Detection

This is an implementation of the winnowing algorithm at the core of Stanford's
MOSS (Measure of Software Similarity) project and based upon the Winnowing paper
(linked below) by Schleimer, Wilkerson, and Aiken.

## Acknowledgements

Thank you, **Donnie Pinkston**, for mentoring me (patiently!) throughout this
project. I have really appreciated receiving your advice, taking your classes,
hearing your stories, and exploring tangents. You have been an key part of my
experience as a CS major and in maintaining my sanity at Caltech.

Thank you, Caltech's Board of Control and academic Honor Code, for inspiring
this project (for better or for worse...). This journey has been a ride!

source code plagiarism detection. The key papers and their contributors that
